# minecraft-mod-changer

## EXE files
These can be found in the releases.

## Python
CustomTk is needed, install it via pip.
The script is not beautiful and not commented (yet) but it works, feel free to customize it.


## Setup
Go into your .minecraft folder by pressing WIN+R and typing %appdata% into the box. Now go into the .minecraft folder and create three folders called 'mods1', 'mods2' and 'mods3'. Store your mods there but place one set of mods into the original 'mods' folder.
